# Monopoly-based-on-the-University-of-Waterloo

This is a game of Monopoly based on the University of Waterloo, called watopoly.
The gameplay is nearly identical to that of Monopoly but the properties, and some other additional features are based on the university of Waterloo instead of the regular board. This game will come complete with the ability to save a game to a file and load a game from a file. As well as a "testing mode" which allows you to control the number of the dice you roll. 

If you would like to try playing the game, you may download the appropriate executable. 
You may directly open the executable if you would like to start a new game without "testing mode" on. 



Explanation of loading games and testing mode (YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ THIS SECTION IF YOU ARE UNINTERESTED IN USING THESE FEATURES): <br>
If you would like to either load a game or have "testing mode" on. Then you must run the executable from the terminal with the command line the correct command line arguments. <br>
Instructions for the command line arguments you must enter to load a game and/or have testing mode on are:<br>
To start a new game with "testing mode" off: \<executable\> <br>
To load a game with "testing mode" off: <executable> -load \<filename\> <br>
To play a new game with testing mode on: \<executable\> -testing <br>
To load a game with testing mode on: <executable> -load \<filename\> -testing

The files which can be read to load a game have a specified format. To ensure that your file is valid, you may either download some of the saved games we have created for you in the "savedGames" directory of this reposiotry, or you may use a file to which you have "saved" the game to, using the save command during gameplay. <br>
The savedGames folder has 2 saved games, both of which are further along in gameplay (this allows you to try features that are only available later in gameplay, without having to play an entire game). The one called two.txt is a 2 player game, and the one called six.txt is a 6 player game.
